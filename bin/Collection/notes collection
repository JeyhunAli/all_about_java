A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. 
It models the mathematical set abstraction. 
The Set interface contains only methods inherited 
from Collection and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited.


list is order base collection -- dynamic array
for example arraylist vector linkedlist

ArrayList linkedlist --->
 differences arraylist is implementing only list interface, linkedlist is implementing list and queue interface both
 random access is possible arraylist but is not possible in linkedlist 
 both are allow dublicate elements, null element and both are not thread safe 
 
 hashmap doesn't maintane order its key and value pair format hash map random acces possible dublicate not, null value yes, thread safety no
 vector everything is possible even its threat safe it means its synchronized 
 
 hastable and hashmap differences is 
 hashtable is null value is allowed in hashmap but its not allowed in hashtable 
 hashtable is synchcronized but hashmap not hahsmap is not thread safe 

properties file is also kind a collection in java its maintane the value with key and value pair format no ordering no indexing 
random acces is possible and its thread safety its extending hashtable

copyonwritearraylist method to make arraylist threadsafety
concurrenthashmap is the way to make hahsmap threadsafety

there 4 way to achieve synchronization in java 
1 synchronization key word passing along with method or class name 
2 volatile keyword 
3 Atomic variable
4 final keyword


Collection   
ArrayList 
linkedlist
hashSet
